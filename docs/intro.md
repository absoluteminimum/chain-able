imagine there are 2 people by the water, & the goal is to make 10 splashes.

as with most skills, you get better at skipping rocks the more that you do it.
a lot of people cannot skip rocks, or they do not like to skip rocks, but they can still throw rocks and make a splash. think of this like non-fluent/vanilla-calls
```js
Chain.prop()
Chain.longer()
Chain.intoSomeShapes()
```

or throwing a really huge rock into the water, and getting the splashes to make more splashes.
```js
Chain.from({
  prop: null,
  longer: null,
  intoSomeShapes: null,
})
```

using method chaining looks similar to skipping rocks

```js
Chain
  .prop()
  .longer()
  .intoSomeShapes()
```

writing an application with a fluent interface allows people to use it all three ways, and you only have to write it one way.
